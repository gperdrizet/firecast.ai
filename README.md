# Firecast.ai - machine learning wildfire risk forecasting

![Heatmap banner](https://github.com/gperdrizet/firecast.ai/blob/master/project_info/figures/heatmap_cropped.png?raw=true)

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model which can predict wildfire ignition risk in California from publicly available meteorology and fire activity data.

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Description

Wildfires are common, destructive and deadly natural disasters. Current meteorology based wildfire risk prediction methods can be improved upon by: 

1. The application of modern data pipeline automation and machine learning techniques
2. Use of historical wildfire data for model training and validation

This project uses a parallel LSTM neural network to predict geospatialy resolved wildfire ignition risk in California. The model was trained on a combined dataset produced from the USDA historical wildfire activity dataset(1) and meterological data from NOAA's North American Regional Reanalysis(2). This project is currently in the deployment phase. Live prediction data will be avalible for 7 days into the future via API.

## Using this repository
First, clone the repo:

    git clone https://github.com/gperdrizet/firecast.ai.git
    
Next, you have two options to install required packages:

#### A) Conda. 
This will install a complete copy of the development environment, including all dependencies.

    cd firecast.ai
    conda env create -f environment.yml

#### B) using pip and venv.

    python3 -m venv firecast.ai
    source firecast.ai/bin/activate
    cd firecast.ai
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
Due to size and space constraints, only the final training dataset and its derivatives are included in this repo. Raw and intermediate data files created by the training data pipeline are not hosted on 
github, but can be found [here](https://www.perdrizet.org/data/firecast.ai/). Note: total size on disk is 326G, ~2500 files.
